# Operating-Systems-and-C-programming

This repository is designed to help you understand operating systems and their connection with low-level languages. In this repo, we will provide examples of Linux being used in tandem with C programs to display executions in the terminal.

The exercises will be aligned with the CS 4315 course at the University of Houston-Downtown. Feel free to explore the repo and learn what you want!
